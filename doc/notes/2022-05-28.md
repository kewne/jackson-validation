# Constructor argument based validation is fundamentally incompatible with JSON deserialization?

Suppose you have classes:

```java
class Root {

    private final Nested nested;

    public Root(@NotNull Nested nested, @NotNull String other) {
        this.nested = nested;
    }
}

class Nested {

    private final String name;

    public Nested(@NotNull String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

This structure would map to the JSON object like:
```json
{
    "nested": {
        "name": "foo"
    },
    "other": "bar"
}
```

However, if we instead pass in 

```json
{
    "nested": {}
}
```

we would expect two violations to be reported:

1. `nested.name` must not be `null`
2. `other` must not be `null`

The problem occurs because it is seemingly impossible to call `new Root` with a valid value
for `nested`: the obvious choice would be to pass `null` but that would fail the "not null" check.

Since the call to `new Nested` needs to validated before the one to `new Root`, we could do the following:

1. validate the call to `new Nested`;
   1. if it passes, no action is required;
   2. if not, we record the fact that validation failed and return a `null` value;
2. validate the call to `new Root`
   1. if it passes, no action is required;
   2. if not, we **filter out the violations relative to `nested`** 
3. merge the violations from 1.2 into the result of 2 (rewriting the path)

Alternatively, we can relax
